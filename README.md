caterpillar game using python


To make the crawler game with Python, the biggest challenge is knowing how to move it around the screen. To move it around the screen, Iâ€™ll use an infinite loop. Each time the loop goes around, the caterpillar moves forward slightly. When the loop repeats quickly, these small movements will create the illusion that the caterpillar is crawling.
